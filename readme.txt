Type './test' to run
Player 1 is Bob, Player 2 is Peter
Both players start with 7 cards in their hand
Books are defined as 2 cards of the same rank
Each player is only allowed one action per turn 
	i.e. can get a card from a player or the deck but cannot ask for another card even if a book is formed.
Game ends when the deck and hands are empty
Player with the most books wins.
