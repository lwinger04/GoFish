Player 1 is Bob, Player 2 is Peter
Both players start with 7 cards in their hand
Books are defined as 2 cards of the same rank
Each player is allowed to ask for cards until the ask becomes unsuccessful
However, if the ask fails and the player draws a card that creates a book, they may not ask again. Their turn is over.
Game ends when the deck and hands are empty
Player with the most books wins.
